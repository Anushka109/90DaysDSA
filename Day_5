When function is called within the same function, it is known as recursion in C++. The function which calls the same function, is known as recursive function.
A function that calls itself, and doesn't perform any task after function call, is known as tail recursion. In tail recursion, we generally call the same function with return statement.
Here I have done a program to find the Factorial of a number by using recursion

#include<iostream>  
using namespace std;    
int main()  
{  
int factorial(int);  
int fact,value;  
cout<<"Enter any number: ";  
cin>>value;  
fact=factorial(value);  
cout<<"Factorial of a number is: "<<fact<<endl;  
return 0;  
}  
int factorial(int n)  
{  
if(n<0)  
return(-1); /*Wrong value*/    
if(n==0)  
return(1);  /*Terminating condition*/  
else  
{  
return(n*factorial(n-1));      
}  
	}
